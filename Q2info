Have you ever felt confused about where to say AND in numbers? You are most certainly not alone!

     ▼1 0   tens

▼ where to say ‘and’

There are 3 important points you should know about AND in numbers:

AND is only used in numbers above 100:

1▼10       one hundred AND ten

AND is used after the first digit in every group of 3 numbers (hundreds) that contain tens or units:

1▼55       one hundred AND fifty-five
3▼01       three hundred AND one

For large numbers, say AND in every group of 3 numbers after the first digit. Don’t say ‘and’ to represent
the thousand separator:

1,5▼50             one thousand five hundred AND fifty
1,5▼05             one thousand five hundred AND five
7▼26,9▼03       seven hundred AND twenty-six thousand, nine hundred AND three
2,9▼02,3▼47    two million, nine hundred AND two thousand, three hundred AND forty-seven

Now look at these numbers. What do you notice?

1,500           one thousand, five hundred
700,100       seven hundred thousand, one hundred

There is no AND! Do you know why?

It’s because these numbers have no tens or units. Also, don’t say ‘and’ for the thousand separator.

Tip: remember that AND is used in every group of three numbers that contains tens or units. To help you visualise this,
AND is a link between the hundreds and the tens or units.

You might occasionally hear native speakers omitting AND in numbers. However, to many people, it sounds wrong.
The correct use of AND in numbers is an international standard.
